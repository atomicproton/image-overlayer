# image-overlayer
Simple web server to compound black and white images on top of each other. Each image is resized to be the same aspect ratio as a vertical sheet of paper.

An inverted version of each image is generated upon upload. New images are generated by using an inverted version of the previously generated image as an image mask. The inverted version of the uploaded image is then composited with the original uploaded using the mask.

Run at your own risk. This was written as quickly as possible and as such probably contains many security vullnerabilities.
- For example, there are no rules on the uploads other than that they must be jpg/png files. It does not check that they are valid images either.
